<h1>About</h1>
<p>The order of routes is important because the Router uses a first-match wins strategy when matching routes, so more specific routes should be placed above less specific routes. List routes with a static path first, followed by an empty path route, which matches the default route. The wildcard route comes last because it matches every URL and the Router selects it only if no other routes match first.</p>
<p>Service workers function as a network proxy. They intercept all outgoing HTTP requests made by the application and can choose how to respond to them. For example, they can query a local cache and deliver a cached response if one is available. Proxying isn't limited to requests made through programmatic APIs, such as fetch; it also includes resources referenced in HTML and even the initial request to index.html. Service worker-based caching is thus completely programmable and doesn't rely on server-specified caching headers.</p>
<h3>Getting route information</h3>
<p>Often, as a user navigates your application, you want to pass information from one component to another. For example, consider an application that displays a shopping list of grocery items. Each item in the list has a unique id. To edit an item, users click an Edit button, which opens an EditGroceryItem component. You want that component to retrieve the id for the grocery item so it can display the right information to the user.</p>
